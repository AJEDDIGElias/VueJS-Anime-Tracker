## ❓ Why? [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
The goal of this project was to learn the basics of VueJS. This project was a big project : a anime watchlist application. 
In this page, we can :
- Search for every anime
- Read the synopsis of every anime
- Add/Remove an anime from the WatchList
- Increase/Decrease number of episode viewed

## ✨ Tech stack [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
For this project, I used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for default package management for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment from Node.js and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)the open-source JavaScript framework used to build single-page user interfaces and web applications. In this project, I've discover Vite. [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a no bundler dev environment for Vue.js. It speeds up the front-end development experience of an application. Vite delivers the code via native ES Module imports during development, allowing me to create Vue. js single-file components without having to bundle them.


## 💾 Install [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

## 🎛️ API [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
I use the API called [Jikan  API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/). It's a free and opensource API used by [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
